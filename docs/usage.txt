usage: xlunch [options]
    xlunch is a program launcher/option selector similar to dmenu or rofi.
    By default it launches in full-screen mode and terminates after a selection is made,
    it is also possible to close xlunch by pressing Esc or the right mouse button.
    Some options changes this behaviour, the most notable being the desktop mode switch:
        -d, --desktop                      Desktop mode, always keep the launcher at
                                           background(behind other windows), and ignore ESC
                                           and right mouse click. Combined with --dontquit
                                           xlunch never exits (behaviour of --desktop from
                                           previous versions).
    Functional options:
        --config [file]                    Reads configuration options from a file. The
                                           options are the same as the long options
                                           specified here. Options that take a value must
                                           have a colon (':') before it's option. It is
                                           also possible to pass the entries along with the
                                           configuration file by using "entries:"
                                           followed by a newline and the regular contents
                                           of an input file
        -v, --version                      Returns the version of xlunch
        -H, --help                         Shows this help message
        --name                             POSIX-esque way to specify the first part of
                                           WM_CLASS (default: environment variable 
                                           RESOURCE_NAME or argv[0])
        -N, --notitle                      Do not display any titles under/around icons
        -n, --noprompt                     Hides the prompt, only allowing selection
                                           by icon
        -o, --outputonly                   Do not run the selected entry, only output it
                                           to stdout
        -S, --selectonly                   Only allow an actual entry and not free-typed
                                           commands. Nice for scripting.
        -i, --input [file]                 File to read entries from, defaults to stdin
                                           if data is available otherwise it reads from
                                           $HOME/.config/xlunch/entries.dsv or
                                           /etc/xlunch/entries.dsv
        -m, --multiple                     Allow multiple instances running
        -t, --voidclickterminate           Clicking anywhere that's not an entry terminates
                                           xlunch, practical for touch screens.
        --focuslostterminate               When the window loses focus xlunch will quit,
                                           practical for menus
        -q, --dontquit                     When an option is selected, don't close xlunch.
                                           Combined with --desktop xlunch
                                           never exits (behaviour of --desktop from
                                           previous versions).
        -R, --reverse                      All entries in xlunch as reversly ordered.
        -W, --windowed                     Start in windowed mode

        --icon                             Specifies the icon to put on the window when
                                           running in windowed mode.
        -M, --clearmemory                  Set the memory of each entry to null before
                                           exiting. Used for passing sensitive information
                                           through xlunch.
        -U, --shortcuts [shortcuts]        Sets shortcuts for the entries, 'shortcuts' is a
                                           string of UTF-8 characters to use sequentially
                                           for the entries provided.
        -A, --button [button]              Adds a button to the window. The argument
                                            "button" is a semicolon-separated list on the
                                           form "<icon>;<highlight icon>;<x>,<y>;<command>"
                                           If x or y is negative positioning is relative
                                           to the other side of the screen.
        --noscroll                         Disable scroll in xlunch. Ignore entries
                                           that can't fit the screen.
        --stdinpolltimeout [i]             How long xlunch should wait (in milliseconds)
                                           for data on stdin before assuming it is
                                           invalid. Use if you find that your xlunch
                                           menu ends up empty on occasion, even though
                                           the entries you pass to xlunch through stdin
                                           are sound. Defaults to 10.

    Multi monitor setup: xlunch cannot detect your output monitors, it sees your monitors
    as a big single screen. You can customize this manually by setting windowed mode and
    providing the top/left coordinates and width/height of your monitor screen which
    effectively positions xlunch on the desired monitor. Use the following options:
        -x, --xposition [i]                The x coordinate of the launcher window
                                           Use negative number to align from right
        -y, --yposition [i]                The y coordinate of the launcher window
                                           Use negative number to align from bottom
        -w, --width [i]                    The width of the launcher window
        -h, --height [i]                   The height of the launcher window

                                           (default: same as --font)

                                           so use a fully transparent background color if
                                           the image should be drawn as-is.
        --bgfill                           Makes the background keep aspect ratio
                                           while stretching

        -r, --rows [i]                     Numbers of rows to show (without this the max
                                           amount possible is used)
        -b, --border [i]                   Size of the border around the icons and prompt
                                           (default: 1/10th of screen width)
                                           This can also be set to 'auto' in order to
                                           automatically calculate a border taking into
                                           account the margin settings and the
                                           configured columns and rows. You can also specify
                                           border in terms of percentage of screen width by
                                           appending a % sign to the value

        --borderratio [i]                  The ratio of the border to apply above the
                                           content. 0 is no top border, only bottom. 100 is
                                           only top border, no bottom

                                           left of the content. 0 is no left border, only
                                           right. 100 is only left border, no right

                                           of below, this option automatically sets
                                           --columns to 1 but this can be overridden.
        -O, --textotherside                Draw the text on the other side of the icon from
